Use web feeds to **subscribe** to websites and get the **latest content in one place.**

**Feeds put you in control.** It's like subscribing to a podcast, or following a company on Facebook. You don't need to pay or hand over your email address. You get the latest content without having to visit lots of sites, and without cluttering up your inbox. Had enough? Easy: unsubscribe from the feed.

You just need a special app called a **newsreader.**

_**This site explains how to get started.**_
