**Subscribe** to websites and get the **latest content in one place.**

It's like subscribing to a podcast, or following a company on Facebook. You don't need to pay or hand over your email address. And you get the latest content without having to visit lots of sites, and without cluttering up your inbox. You just need a special app called a **newsreader.**

**This site explains how to get started.**

# What is a feed?

A feed is also known as an _"RSS feed"_ or a _"web feed"_. The feed contains the latest content in a form that your **newsreader app** understands. (Your newsreader will check the feed automatically.)

Lots of websites have feeds, mostly news sites and blogs. You'll often see a link at the bottom of the page that says _"RSS"_ or an orange icon. The [Web Feed article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed) at Wikipedia has an example.

Whenever you see a website with a feed, that means you can subscribe to that site.

When you subscribe to only one site, you might say _"This doesn't save me much time."_ But when you end up subscribing to 10 or 20, you'll find that your newsreader becomes your regular place for news and to hear the latest.


# How do I get a newsreader app?

To subscribe to feeds, you'll need a newsreader app. A newsreader app feels a little like an email inbox, in that there is a list of all the latest content, or like Facebook in that there is a newsfeed from many different sources.

There are many different newsreader apps to choose from.

You can install an app on your phone or laptop, or you can use a newsreader app through a website. Here are three apps, in alphabetical order:

* [Feedly](https://feedly.com) -- free up to 100 subscriptions. Web/Android/iOS.
* [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) -- free up to 150 subscriptions. Web/Android/iOS.
* [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) -- free. iOS/Mac.

_It doesn't matter which you choose as newsreaders make it fairly easy to export your list of subscriptions and move them to another app in the future. So choose one you like the look of._

Choose your app, and either sign up or download it.


# How do I use my new newsreader app to subscribe to a feed?

You'll need the **Feed URL.** To get this, go the website you want to subscribe to, and find that RSS link or the feed icon. Then...

* On **desktop,** right click on the link and choose "Copy Link Address" or similar.
* On **mobile,** tap and hold the link until a menu comes up. Choose "Copy link" or similar.

Then go to your newsreader app and look for a function which will be named something like

- "Subscribe"
- "Add Web Feed"
- or maybe a "+" icon

and **paste in the Feed URL.**

You can now read the latest content in your newsreader.


# Who made this site?

**About Feeds** is a free site from [Matt Webb](http://interconnected.org). I made this site because using web feeds for the first time is hard, and that limits the number of people who use feeds. But it's good when web feeds are popular, because

- for **users,** they can read the latest content easily without being bothered by ads and pop-overs... It's a calmer, more pleasant reading experience. And the latest content is guaranteed to get through, and not get lost in the email inbox or get skipped over by a Facebook algorithm.
- for **site owners,** they can reach readers directly, without having to chase virality with clickbait headlines on Twitter, or pay for access on Facebook. Feeds and newsreaders make for a medium that favours the indies and the smaller players.

No-one owns web feeds, so there's no-one collecting all the personal data and profiting off it, or harvesting email addresses. Subscribing is opt-in, so it's spam proof. And that's great.

But also because no-one owns web feeds, it's no-one's responsibility to ensure a great user experience. In particular, I feel that web feeds are not friendly for new users.

My hope is that **About Feeds** can become the default _"What is this?"_ link next to every web feed icon on the web, and I have a ton of ideas of how to make it more and more useful.
